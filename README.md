# Household Pulse Explorable
Goal: Build an interactive application that incorporates fundamental Streamlit components to offer a curated yet open-ended look at a dataset.

The Household Pulse Survey is a weekly survey run by the US Census Bureau that measures how the coronavirus pandemic is impacting households across the country from a social and economic perspective. It’s a valuable and extensive source of data to gain insight on individuals and families, and one that we will only begin to touch on in today’s lab.

To help a user explore this data interactively, we will build a Streamlit application that displays the results of one Household Pulse Survey, which ran from from September 29 to October 11, 2021.
